        <div class="description">
            <p class="body-font">Bruce Nauman was born in 1941 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He studied art, mathematics, and
                physics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison from 1960 to 1964. He went on to study under William
                T. Wiley and Robert Arneson at the University of California at Davis, graduating with an MFA in 1966.
                This was when Nauman first experienced with neon, influenced by his professors' wry wordplay and
                whimsical use of non-art materials.
                <br><br>
                In 1964, Nauman gave up painting and began experimenting with sculpture and Performance art and
                collaborated with William Allan and Robert Nelson on film projects. He supported himself by teaching at
                the San Francisco Art Institute from 1966 to 1968, and at the University of California at Irvine in
                1970.
                <br><br>
                Since the mid-1960s, the artist has created an open-ended body of work that includes sculptures, films,
                holograms, interactive environments, neon wall reliefs, photographs, prints, sculptures, videotapes, and
                performance. His Conceptual work stresses meaning over aesthetics; it often uses irony and wordplay to
                raise issues about existence and alienation, and increasingly it provokes the viewerâ€™s participation and
                dismay.</p>
